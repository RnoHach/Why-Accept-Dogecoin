Why Accept Dogecoin?

Dogecoin is a decentralized digital currency employing blockchain technology. It has no incoming transaction fees, and sending Dogecoin is very cheap (currently under $0.01 for most transactions).
There are no middlemen (banks, credit card companies) who would manipulate or take a % of your earnings (no chargebacks, no penalties, no monthly subscriptions fees). 
Short processing times - transactions clear in a matter of seconds, not days. 
Security - The Dogecoin network is secured by miners and node operators across the world, and soon in space. 
Transparency & anonymity - immutable public record of all transactions, without including identifying information. 
Tap into an ever-increasing global Dogecoin brand recognition and unprecedented customer loyalty. 
Value - publicly endorsed by celebrities like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, Snoop Dog and many more. Accepted by an increasing number of businesses such as Tesla, SpaceX, AMC Theaters, BitPay, BitPlaza, Newegg, Dallas Mavericks, Oakland A’s, AirBaltic, and many more.

Things to keep in mind…

Currently the US government considers cryptocurrencies to be collectible assets, therefore will tax you on any increase of value compared to the continuously inflating US dollar - (short term vs. long term capital gains)
Cryptocurrencies are currently considered volatile, but over the long term they have been appreciating better than stocks and have been a better store of value than gold.
